#### Exercise: Authentication Flow Analysis & Design

#### 1. Use Case Exploration  
Task:
- Visit Website https://t1-electrolux-uat-a.eluxmkt.com/en-gb/
- Navigate through the Login and Registration flows.

Deliverables:
- Describe the steps involved in both flows.
- Identify any third-party integrations (e.g., social login, SSO).
- Note any user experience issues or inconsistencies.

#### 2. Authentication Protocol Identification  
Task:
- Investigate and determine the authentication protocol used (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, SAML, custom JWT-based auth).
- Consider whether any additional protocols could be used to improve the user experience.
Deliverables:
- Provide a brief explanation of the identified protocol.
- Suggest alternative or complementary protocols that could enhance UX.
- Highlight key factors for choosing such protocols (e.g., security, scalability, ease of integration, user convenience).

#### 3. Pseudocode & UI Flow Design  
Task: Design a simplified version of the login and registration flow.
Deliverables:
- Screens Overview
  - Identify exactly which CDC (Customer Data Cloud) screens are used to design the flow.
  - Evaluate whether these screens are optimal for the flow.
  - Suggest improvements or alternative screens that could be used.
- Screen Event Handlers
  - List down screen-level event handlers (e.g., onafterscreenload, onsubmit, etc.) used in each screen.
  - Describe the purpose of each handler and how it contributes to the flow.

#### 4. Document Your Work  
Based on your analysis, suggest improvements to the overall authentication flow and provide documentation suitable for **technical stakeholders** & **non-technical stakeholders**

Include your documentation:
- In a `README.md` section or notebook cell  
- Or in a separate `docs/` folder
