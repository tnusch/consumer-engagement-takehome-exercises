### 4. Engineer â€“ Marketing Data & AI  
#### Exercise: Predict Optimal Send Time for a Marketing Campaign using a Python notebook

#### 1. Analyze the Dataset  
Use the provided [dataset](email_events_1000.csv) containing **email open and click events** per user. The data includes:
- Timestamps of sends, opens, and clicks  
- User IDs 

Explore behavioral patterns by:
- Day of the week  
- Hour of day  
- Frequency of interaction

#### 2. Write a Prediction Script  
Develop a **Python script or notebook** that predicts the best time of day to send marketing emails to each consumer or segment.  
You may use:
- Statistical rules (e.g., most frequent open hour)
- Basic machine learning (optional)
- Aggregations or heuristics

The script should output a list of users (or segments) with their recommended send times.

#### 3. Suggest Ecosystem Integration  
Explain how your output could be integrated into the Electrolux marketing and activation ecosystem.  
- Identify **relevant platforms** from the job posting
- Suggest how the predictions could be exported, activated, or used in real-time orchestration  
- Consider data flows or API usage if relevant

#### 4. Document Your Work  
Provide documentation suitable for:
- **Technical stakeholders**: Describe your data preparation, logic, modeling, and script structure  
- **Non-technical stakeholders**: Summarize what your solution does, how it adds value, and what assumptions were made

Include your documentation:
- In a `README.md` section or notebook cell  
- Or in a separate `docs/` folder

Optional: Add graphs or visuals to illustrate patterns or predictions.
